# Communication Systems and Antennas – Introduction

- Before discussing about the antenna, let us consider an example where there is a communication system and it wants to transfer data to other devices.  
  The conduction of information in communication systems can either be done through:

## COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
- **Transmission Lines**
- **Electromagnetic Radiation**

## What are Transmission Lines?

- In low-frequency circuits, we use ordinary wires for connections and usually don’t bother much about their effects.
- But at high frequencies, the same wire cannot be used in the same way.

  **Analogy:**  
  If a 2-year-old tries to hit me, I can withstand the effect and it doesn’t bother me much. This is because of the difference in sizes between me and the child.  
  But if another 20-year-old tries to hit me, that bothers me because my size and his size are comparable.

- Likewise, in low-frequency systems:
  - The wavelength of the waves travelling in the wire and the dimensions of the wire are **not comparable**.

- But in the case of high frequency:
  - The wavelength becomes **comparable to the wire dimensions**  
  - Since \( \lambda = \frac{c}{f} \), as \( f \) increases, wavelength decreases.

- This leads to a phenomenon known as the **skin effect**, where:
  - The current in the wire is pushed towards the surface of the conductor.
  - The current will not be able to efficiently trans
